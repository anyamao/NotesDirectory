Nothing bad with using Vite for react web app creation.
Also you need nodejs to write code outside of the browser



---Basic structure notes------------------------------------------------------

tsconfig.json is a file that stores dependencies, you cant comment here

package-lock.json file that locks all the versions used in this projects so when another
person tries to run it it will install these same versions, ensuring it will work

index.html in this file you have <div id="root"></div> this is the entry point
of vite, here all the web application goes.
<script type ="module" src = "/src/main.tsx"></script> this is the script for initializing
your application

eslint.config.js - config to add settings to eslint, a tool for finding problems in the code

node_modules - is a folder that contains all the installed dependencies, thats why its so huge,
its managed by npm

folder public - a special folder for  statis assets like images and icons, and files here can be acessed
with a special path, for example if we have cat.img i can acess it from each file as /cat.img 

folder src - the folder where you keep all the scripts and documents with code, not images

App.tsx - the main UI component of the web app. you use it to import the components. so it will look like

const App = () =>{
    return(
    <div  className = "...">

      <Header/>
      <MainContent/>
      <Footer/>

    </div>

    )
  }

....


main.tsx - the entry point of the react App, also there we import the main styles file index.css

App.css is the styling file for App.tsx


------------------------------------------------------------------------------





---When wanting to create a react app--------------------------------

1)cd into a parent folder of web projects and here run-    npm create vite@latest
this is the basic command which will prompt the installer to ask you for a name and stack

2) cd into the project you have now created and do -     npm install
this command installs all the necessary dependencies to safely run the web app

3) if you want to use tailwind the documentation may change i used the official tailwindcss guide for vite
npm install @tailwincss/vite
then import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite' to vite.config.js, remove the react plugin completely
insert tailwindcss() where react() has been
add @import "tailwindcss" to the index.css file
try to test it just in case

------------------------------------------------------------------------- 




---Basic Components Syntax---------------------------------------------------------------

you can make a component like
function App(){
    ....
  }

or you can with
const App = ()=>{
    ....
  }

you need to export it at the end with
export default App
to use a component inside another component you just

const App = () =>{
    return (
    <Component/>
    )
  }

But this will just display the same component over and over again. To make it 
look different we use props, passing data from one comp to another through props.
its better to make a separate interface for props like this

interface ComponentProps {
    title:string;
    rating:number;
    cost:number
  }

cost Component = () =>{
    return (
    <div>
    {title}{rating}{cost}
    </div>
    )
  }

you can move Component into a separate file and add export default Component;
and then you need to add import Component from './Component'; (name of the file component is in)

and then you can import it to other components 
 const App = () =>{
    return (
    <div>
    <Component title="Star Wars" rating = {20} cost = {19}/>
    </div>
    )
  }

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---Styling rules-------------------------------------------------------------

its nice to keep a design system to ensure elements dont look odd. first go to index.css and delete everything
then for basics just
you can use google color picker for nice HEX representation. to add tawildind classes you will repeat add @layer components

then choose a font you want to use on google fonts and follow the instructions given there.


@layer components {
    .movie-div{
        @apply bg-pink-300 rounded-[50px] hover:scale-125 transition-transform
      }
  }
*{
    color: #241a16
    font-family: of choice;
    font-size:12px;
  }
body{
    width:100vw;
    height:100vw;
    min-height:100vw;
    display:flex;
  }

also since App.tsx is the entry point of all the component you can add two parent divs in it like

const App = () =>{
    return (
    <div className = "min-w-screen min-h-screen justify-center flex py-[20px]">
    
    </div>
    )
  }

also to make reusable components you can make them in index.css or in any css file
with
@ layer component{
    .window{
        @apply w-[30px];
      }
  }

you need to keep reusable text sizes and colors in a global file and the css files only used in a specific page in the page
folder in pages
---------------------------------------------------------------------


---Organizing files-------------------------------------------------------------

in src folder:
you add components folder for reusable components like header/Footer
you add pages folder where you make another folder for each page 
and in the page folder you keep all the components used for this page plus the page component itself.
like Timer.tsx TimerCreating.tsx timer.css
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---Use State and Use Effect--------------------------------------------------------

to use use state you need to import it like this

import {useState} from 'react'

you use it inside a const like

const Component = () =>{

  const [hasLiked,setHasLiked] = useState(false);

    return(
    ....

    <button onClick={() =>{
        setHasLiked((prevState)=> !prevState);
      }}
    )
  }

  const [count,setCount] = useState(0);
  

you can add useEffect to where you imported useState

then if you want to use useEffect you do this

useEffect( ()=>{
    console.log('smth')
  }[count]);:\Users\Vika\Downloads
this [count] means useEffect will only work when count changes, not always

if you add empty [] it will run only once on the mounting of the component it is in, when reloading.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---Routing----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

you need to first install the package

npm install react-router-dom

then you need to go to main.tsx and 

import {createBrowserRoutr, RouterProvider} from 'react-router-dom';

and add const router

const router = createBrowserRouter([
{
    path:'/timer',
    element:<Timer/>,
  },
  {
      path:"*"
      element: </NotFound/>  //this component is 404 error handler.
    }
])

and inside strict mode you  add

<StrictMode>
<RouterProvider router={router}/>
</StrictMode

and then in your header or wherever you

import {Link} from 'react-router-dom'

and make a link component

<Link to="/diary" className="...">.....</Link>




----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---Using github------------------------------------------

so if you screwed up you just        rm -rf .git          and it removes all the git stuff

git init 
git add .
git commit -m "message"

gh repo create 
git remote add origin https://github.com/anyamao/repo.name
git push -u origin master

when want to update to the latst version - git pull origin master

when prompted for a password

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub - copy the key

add the key to github settings ssh keys new ssh key

ssh -T git@github.com    


turns out you need to copy with ssh and then it will be ok

so just git remote add-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git

---------------------------------------------------

----Small things-----------------
  to run a cpp file you should install cpp compiler first
  then to run it while waiting for input run it like that 
  g++ prefix.cpp -o prefix && ./prefix
