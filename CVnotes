to install packages on python you need to create virtual environment
in every project folder
python -m venv .venv

activate it before every pip install
source .venv/bin/activate

install stuff with pip install

pip install opencv-contrib-python
pip  install caer


since i use wsl i needed to also install and configure Xlaunch, because otherwise the popup
would not work. 
to check the popup you can run this:

import cv2 as cv 
img = cv.imread("catimg.jpg")

if img is None:
  print("image not found")
else:
  cv.imshow("cat",img)
  cv.waitKey(0)

for now if the image is large it will go off screen
